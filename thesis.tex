% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
We prove two new results about 0-1-fillings of skew diagrams avoiding long increasing
and decreasing chains. In the first half of the thesis, we show that for a large class of skew diagrams, there
is a bijection between sparse fillings avoiding an increasing chain of fixed length
and sparse fillings avoiding a decreasing chain of the same length.
In the second half, we extend a known inequality between the number of sparse 0-1-fillings of skew diagrams avoiding an increasing chain of length 2
and a decreasing chain of length 2 to all 0-1-fillings.
